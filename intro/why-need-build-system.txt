title: Why we need build system?

content:
1st-para:
    C++ is a good coding language, but it doesn't provide convenient tool to generate code.
    Build system is a tool to quick generate code in a very short way. 
    Often the past way using compiler should input a long list of cmds, this will have many repeated work and just waste time.
    Later, emerging tools as Makefile, it could encapsulate long cmds to a short format.
    But not good as expected, because the design time of Makefile is very old, having so many defects which makes it hard to learn and maintain.
    So CMake just birth to solve problems as build project and generate code.
    It is not perfect in any situation, but having lots of benefits than others, which is very popular in C++ coders.
    In short, CMake can use in computer, embedded system for C/C++ projects.

2nd-para:
    Another reason to use CMake is that it is cross-platform. it is a high level concept, because people find that some code in different platform have same logic.
    So the final software developed goal is back to the proverb "Write once, run everywhere".
    And it is also a hard dream, but with perseverance we will reach it.
